## Building a HTTP Server From Scratch

Go to [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org) and click on the `Get Started` button and follow the instructions to install Rust for your operating system.

You should get somewhat similar output if you run commands like the ones below (newer versions are okay).  If you 
already have an old version of Rust installed, then run `rustup update` to install a newer version.
```shell
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.55.0 (c8dfcfe04 2021-09-06)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.55.0 (32da73ab1 2021-08-23)
```

Cargo is a Rust's build system and package manger. 
Cargo helps in downloading the libraries on which code depends on, and building those libraries.

To create new project using cargo,
`cargo new my_project --bin or --lib`
